# World’s Worst Twitter Client
World’s Worst Twitter Client is a Twitter client that stores drafts and posts them to Twitter. I made it for my AP Computer Science final project to learn more about OAuth and Swing (Java graphics).

Please don’t use it for anything important. Its codebase is littered with edge-case bugs. This is a *demo*, not a *product*.

## License
None! This program is public domain. Seriously.

I have no idea why you would want to, but if you use it for something, I’d love to see it!

## Linux?
If you’re running this on Linux, pass in these arguments to make Java use GTK, and not the ugly Java look and feel.
```
-Dawt.useSystemAAFontSettings=on -Dswing.defaultlaf=com.sun.java.swing.plaf.gtk.GTKLookAndFeel
```
